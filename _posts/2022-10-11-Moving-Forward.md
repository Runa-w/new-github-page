This is my first blog post as a python developer. I can remember last year when I first began coding, thinking I would be something of the 
hoodie in a dark room stereotype - having no idea what I was even talking about. Fast forward through HTML, CSS, design basics, WordPress, Shopify, the brick wall that
was JavaScript, and I set my sights on Python. This language I kept hearing mentioned by developers and scientists alike, but merely touched on the coding
platforms I was learning from such as Codecademy and The Odin Project (probibly one of the best free learning platforms I have used) seemed like an enigma 
to me.
